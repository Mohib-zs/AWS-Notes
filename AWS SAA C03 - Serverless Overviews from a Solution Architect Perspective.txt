Serverless is a paradigm where developers dont manage servers anymore, they just deploy code or functions. Intially Serverless was aka FaaS (Function as a Service) It wa pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's remotely managed like databases, messaging, storage etc. Serverless means you dont manage, provision and see servers. A usecases of Lambda is Users calling Rest API via AWS API Gateway to invoke Lambda to pull data from DB and present to users. Some example serverless services are Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, API Gateway, S3, SNS & SQS, Kinesis Data Firehose, Aurora Serverles, Step Functions, Fargate.

Lambda are virtual functions not servers, they are limited by time (used for short event based executions), they run on-demand, scaling is automated. Benefits of Lambda is easy pricing (you pay per request and compute time), free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time. Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services, Integraed with many programming languages, Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch, Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM per function) and increasing the RAM will also improve CPU and network. 

AWS Lambda supports langs like Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Java, C# (.NET Core) / Powershell, Ruby, Custom Runtime API (community supported, example Rust or Golang). Also supports docker images but they must implement the Lambda Runtime API. ECS/Fargate is preferred for running arbitary Docker images.

Main integrations of Lambda with AWS services are API Gateway to create a REST API to invoke Lambda functions, Kinesis to perform transformations on the fly, DynamoDB to perform a function on each DB event, S3 to execute function on any event like file change, CloudFront for Lambda at edge usage, CloudWatch Events/ Eventbridge to execute some automated step whenever something occurs in our Infra like state change in code pipeline, CloudWatch Logs to stream logs wherever we want, SNS to react to notifications in your SNS topics, SQS to process messages from your SQS queues, Cognito to react whenever a user logs into our DB.

e.g is to create a serverless cron job by attaching cloudwatch eventbridge that will be triggered every one hour and every one hour it will be integrated with the Lambda function to perform your tasks.
