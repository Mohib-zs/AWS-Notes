CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS, Metrics (CPU Utilization, Network) belong to namespaces and a Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, env etc..) and you can have upto 30 dimensions per metric. Metrics have time stamps and e.g of custom CloudWatch metrics are RAM utilization of Ec2 instance. For continuous streaming of CloudWatch metrics into target destinations with "near-real-time delivery" and low latency, use CW Metric streams and targets can be Firehose or 3rd party SaaS like DataDog, Splunk, New Relic etc. Can also filter metrics to stream a subset only. 

In CloudWatch Logs, Log groups are an arbitrary name, usually for an app and Log streams are instances within app/log files/containers. You can define log expiration policies (never expire, 1 day to 10 years). CloudWatch Logs can send logs to S3 (exports), Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose, Lambda, OpenSearch. Logs are encrypted by default and you can setup KMS-based encryption with your own keys. CloudWatch Log sources are SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent or Unified agent, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, Lambda, VPC Flow Logs, API Gateway, CloudTrail based on filter, Route53 (For DNS Insights). CW Log Insights provide a purpose-built query language to search and analyze log data based on conditions, desired fields or filters (like find a specific ip or number of "ERROR" occurrences in your logs). CW Insights can query multiple log groups in different AWS accounts, can save queries to CW dashboards. Its a query engine not a real-time engine. CW Logs Subscriptions allows is to get real-time log events from CW logs for processing and analysis. Send to KDS (and then to Firehose, KDA, EC2, Lambda), Firehose (and from there to S3 in near-real-time) or Lambda (and then to OpenSearch service in real-time). CW Log Aggregation for multi-account where CW Logs send to subscription filters of their respective accounts to a single KDS, from their to Firehose which send near-real-time data to S3. Though a Destination Access policy is required for sender account to send log data to receiver account, and an IAM role is needed for the subscription destination to send data to KDS (role should be cross-account assumable by sender account). Subscriptions fiters (SF) includ ElasticSearch SF, Kinesis SF, Firehose SF, Lambda SF. Use live-tail to see the logs in detail like the time they were created and from which stream.

CW Logs Agents: By default no logs from your ec2 will go to CloudWatch, need to run an agent on EC2 to push the log files you want. Ec2 must also have IAM role so the sent logs can be shown in CW Logs. CW log agent can be setup on-prem as well. However CW logs agent is a old version which can only send logs. CW Unified agent collects and sends additional info (metrics) like RAM, process etc. Also sends logs to CW logs obv, and all your CW unified agents can have their configuration centralized via SSM parameter store. CW Unified Agent collected metrics in form of CPU (active, guest, idle) or Disk Metrics (free, used, total) Disk IO (writes, reads, bytes, iops) RAM (free, inactive, used) Netstat (number of TCP and UDP connections, net packets) Processes (total, dead, sleep) Swap Space (free, used %). Out-of-the-box for EC2 is disk, CPU, network.

Alarms trigger notifications for metrics with options like min, max sampling etc. Alarm States are OK, INSUFFICIENT_DATA (not enough data to trigger alarm) and ALARM (threshold exceeded). Period is length of time in seconds with High resolution custom metrics like 10 sec, 30 sec or multiples of 60 sec. CW Alarm Targets stop, terminate, reboot or recover and EC2 instance. Trigger Auto-scaling or send notification to SNS (to do pretty much anything we want). However CW Alarms are on a single metric, for multiple metrics, use composite alarms that monitor the state of other alarms. They use AND and OR conditions. Helpful to reduce "alarm noise" by creating complex composite alarms. e.g for an EC2, composite alarms monitors the alarms monitoring for CPU and IOPS, in an AND condition, both alarms must trigger for the composite to trigger as well to trigger SNS. EC2 instance recovery includes CW Alarms check for instance status, system status (hardware state), Attached EBS status, if alarms is triggered, it host changes from A to B while keeping the same private, public IP, metadata and placement group.
