AWS CloudFront is a CDN with 216 points of global presence (edge locations), provides DDOS protection with Shield, AWS Web App Firewall. It basically helps with caching of content to edge locations close to the user for faster load times. CloudFront Origins are used in S3 bucket for distributing files and caching them at the edge, enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC), which is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI) and CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3). Also can be used for any custom origin (HTTP) backend like ALB, EC2, S3 (static website only) or any HTTP backend. OAC is used to protect the access control on the S3 bucket's contents + S3 bucket policies are modified as well for this security. CloudFront is a global edge network where files are cached for a TTL (e.g 1 day), and are great for static content that must be available everywhere. S3 Cross region replication needs to be setup for each region where you want replication to happen, files are updated in near real-time, its read only and great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions. the edge location will make request to the origin (EC2, ALB...) via AWS private network (very fast) but you would need to setup OAC for it. The default case would be cloudfront resolving the public dns or ip of the origin (ec2, alb...). Best case is to make cloudfront request to the public ALB, which makes request to the private ec2 instances. 

Cloudfront Geo restriction allows restriction on your distribution with allowlist which allows users from a country and blocklist which blocks users from accessing your content from a country. Country is determined by using a 3rd party Geo-IP database. Use case is copyright laws to control access to content.
