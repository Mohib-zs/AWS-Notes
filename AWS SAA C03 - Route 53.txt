Domain Registrar's are Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy etc.
DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS,.. (must knows)
Zone File: Contains DNS Records
Name Server: Resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or Non-Authoritative)
Top Level Domain (TLD):.com, .us, .in, .gov, .org, ...
Second Level Domain (SLD): amazon.com, google.com,..

in http://api.www.example.com. 	
. in the end is root, .com is TLD, .example.com is SLD, .www.example.com. is sub-domain and api.www.example.com is the FQDN and http:// is the protocol. FQDNs do not include the protocol (https://) or path (/products) — that’s part of the URL, not the domain. https://blog.shop.example.com/products is a URL.

TTL (Time To Live) is the amount of time the record is cached at DNS Resolvers. Routing policy is how Route 53 responds to queries. A record maps hostname to IPv4, AAAA maps hostname to IPv6, CNAME maps a hostname to another hostname, where target is a domain name with A or AAAA record. Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (zone apex) example you can't create for example.com but can create for www.example.com, NS (Name Server) for the hosted zone controls how traffic is routed for a domain.

Hosted Zones is a container for records that define how to route traffic to domains and their subdomains, pulic-hosted zones cotain records of how you route traffic to public domains while private-hosted zones contain records that specify how you route traffic to private domains defined in one or more VPCs or internal networks. You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone you create in Amazon Route 53 and $12 per year for each domain you register in it. Enable auto-renew to auto-renew domain after 1 year if required. 

High TTL e.g 24 HR means less traffic on route 53 but clients will possibly have outdated records and will have to wait 24HR to get new record change, Low TTL e.g 60 sec means more traffic on Route 53 and more kharcha ($$) but records are outdated for less time means if you make A record change, client can access the new record after 60 seconds, easy to change records. Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS record. 

Pointing a hostname to another hostname, you can use CNAME for this (app.mydomain.com > something.anything.com) but only for NON ROOT DOMAIN so can't use "domain.com" you would rather use app.domain.com. Alias can also be used to point a hostname to an AWS resource  (app.mydomain.com > something.amazonaws.com) and it works for both ROOT AND NON ROOT DOMAIN and it is free of charge with native health check capability. Alias or ANAME is AWS/provide-specific not standard. Automatically recognizes changes in the resource's ip changes since it resolves to the ip of the hostname it is mapped to. Unlike CNAME, it can be used for Top node of a DNS Namespace (zone apex) e.g example.com. Alias record is of type A/AAAA for AWS resources (IPv4/IPv6), you can't set the TTL.

Alias Record targets are:
ELB (ALB, NLB)
CLoudFront Distributions
API Gateway
Elastic Beanstalk environments
S3 Websites endpoint (when buckets are enabled as websites)
VPC Interface Endpoints
Global Accelerator accelerator
Route 53 record in the same hosted zone

You cannot set an alias record for an EC2 DNS name.

Routing policies define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries, it's not the same as LoadBalancer routing which routes the traffic. DNS does not route traffic rather responds to DNS queries. Following are the routing policies

Simple routing policy routes to a single resource, though you can specify multiple values in the same record, if multiple values are returned, a random value would be chosen by client, only one AWS resource can be specified when AWS resource is enabled though it can't be associated with health checks.
