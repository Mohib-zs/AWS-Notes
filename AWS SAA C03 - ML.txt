Amazon Transcribe automatically converts speech to text, uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately. Automatically removes personally Identifiable Information (PII) using redaction e.g age, gender, SSN. Supports auto language identification for multi-lingual audio. Use cases are to transcribe customer service calls, automate closed captioning and subtitling, generate metadata for media assets to create a fully searcable archive.

Amazon Polly is the opposite of Amazon Transcribe, it turns text into life-like speech. Polly allows us to customize the pronunciation of words with "pronunciation lexicons", e.g Styled words: M0H1B => MOHIB or Acronyms: AWS => Amazon Web Services. Upload the lexicons and use them in the SynthesizeSpeech operation. You can generate speech from plain text or from documents marked up with "Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)" - enables more customization, like emphasizing specific words or phrases, using phonetic pronunciation, including breathing/whispering sounds or using the newscaster speech style. Neural mode produces the most natural and human-like speech possible, while standard produces natural-sounding speech.
